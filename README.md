# Terrain-Fix  
Fix for TerrainTiles.json for use in Tiled 1.8.5+ for OMORI modding.    

Drop the TerrainTiles.json inside of the playtest\maps folder, then when Tiled loads TerrainTiles.json they shouldn't be a jumbled unreadable mess.    
Do not use this file in your actual mod! theres no point in adding it and it *shouldnt* change anything.
